# Network Architecture Course Notes
This repository contains notes from a network architecture course that I took. The course covered a range of topics, including:

- Network topologies and protocols
- TCP/IP and OSI models
- Network devices, such as routers and switches
- Network security and firewalls
- Virtual private networks (VPNs)

The notes are organized by topic and provide an overview of the material covered in the course, including key concepts and examples. They are meant to be a helpful resource for anyone looking to learn more about network architecture or preparing for a certification exam.
